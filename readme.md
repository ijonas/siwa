## Siwa Oracle 

## OVERVIEW:
    This code base provides a CLI for running and interacting various data production algorithms which are then collected by another service and saved to the blockchain. 

## Setup:
    You should run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

    You should also run setup.py to install sentiment analysis data for the twitter sentiment analyzer.

    Each feed may itself require separate setup. 
    See the /feeds directory and the readme.md files therein

## Files:
* `siwa.py` - provides CLI interface / thread handling
* `siwa_logging.py` log handler to log to SQLite
* `endpoint.py` http/json endpoint, run automatically via siwa CLI, or standalone
* `all_feeds.py` - all enabled datafeeds from `feeds/`
* `feeds/data_feed.py` - defines class structure shared by all datafeeds
* `feeds/*.py` - e.g. `gauss.py` - defines an individual datafeed

## Examples:
    endpoint example: http://127.0.0.1:16556/datafeed/gauss
    (you may need to pre-populate by running gauss for a second)

## Datafeed Notes:
* Twitter datafeed returns (as a datapoint) an "average-of-past-5-tweets" sentiment value between -1 and +1 (totally negative to totally positive), currently this means if following more than one username or term, the sentiment would be averaged across the most recent 5 tweets from everything followed -- this could later be modified to create separate data for separate users, or to consider an average-of-averages (5 tweets per user/hashtag/term, instead of 5 tweets total)

## Datafeed IDs:
* 1 gauss -> gauss
* 2 crypto_indices -> MCAP1000
* 3 stablecoins -> USDC
* 4 stablecoins -> BUSD
* 5 stablecoins -> Tether
* 6 stablecoins -> DAI
* 7 Twitter -> sentiment per user ID per last n tweets

## Prometheus Metrics
Siwa has an exposed `metrics/` endpoint. This endpoint shalle be consumed and scraped by a Prometheus server hosted by Overlay.

### Production
In production deployment, Siwa's metrics endpoint should be accessible to the Prometheus server.

### Relevant files for Prometheus metrics
- prometheus_metrics.py
  - This is where Prometheus metrics are initialized.
- endpoint.py
  - This is where the Prometheus metrics endpoint is defined.
- apis/csgoskins.py
  - This is where the csgo-related metrics are updated. Refer to this line of code specifically `prometheus_metrics.csgo_index_gauge.set(index)`.

    ```
    def get_index(self, df, caps):
        # Get caps
        df = df.merge(caps, on=self.MARKET_HASH_NAME_KEY, how='inner')
        ...
        # Set prometheus metric to index
        print(f'Set prometheus metric to index {index}')
        prometheus_metrics.csgo_index_gauge.set(index)
        return index
    ```
